This code demonstrates how to use the Github V3 API to retrieve a list of all users on Github.

The API call used is: https://api.github.com/search/users?q

And it can only retrieve basic info about each user such as:

    - Login/username
    - followers url
    - following url
    - organizations url
    - repos url

Which is what is being displayed in each user card. You can click any user card profile picture and it will open a new window for that user displaying all public info related to that user.
The same goes for the card buttons.
